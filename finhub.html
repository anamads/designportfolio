        <h3>The Problem Space</h3>
        <img src="images/idea1.png">
      </div>
        <p>
            Many cryptocurrency brands offer websites and apps that are hard to use. Most cryptocurrency exchanges create experiences aimed at tech-savvy investors and might look frightening to beginners or those wanting to try it out, hence the high barriers to investing. In light of the recent boom in blockchain-related products, the demand for accessible user experience among cryptocurrency exchanges has increased tremendously.
        </p>

        <h3>The Goal</h3>
        <img src="images/goal1.png">
      </div>
        <p>
            Create an online experience that would break the barrier to cryptocurrency investing and make a crypto web easy to use.

            Designing an online experience for trust and security is one of the main challenges that have to be tackled.
           
           One of the primary goals is to reduce the learning curve by educating and guiding the users through segmentation depending on the level of their current involvement in crypto exchanges.

          <h3>User Research: Preliminary Survey</h3>
          <p>
            I conducted a round of interviews that included questions such as asking which cryptocurrency exchange platforms users heard of or tried to use, what concerns they had while using the platform, and their familiarity with the benefits and downsides of using cryptocurrencies.

​

The main goal of the research was to determine which goals users pursue when using the platforms and understand if users struggle with any concerns while using cryptocurrency exchanges.

​

To better understand the users and their needs, I created 2 personas based on the results of the preliminary survey.

    <h3> The Who, What, and Why</h3>
    <p>To address the challenges that users face and the needs they have when it comes to using the crypto exchanges, I created a list of user stories to navigate the design process.</p>
    <ul class="userpoints sixty">
        <li id="fat">US1: As a crypto exchange user, I want to be able to buy and sell quickly, so that I don’t waste time figuring out how to proceed.</li>
        <li>US2: As a crypto exchange user, I want to be able to make transfers fast so that I can act quickly in changing circumstances.</li>
        <li id="fat">US3: As an account holder, I want to have access to information about fintech so that I make better investment decisions.</li>
        <li>US4: As a crypto exchange user, I want to be able to perform a simple search for questions that match keywords in both the title and body fields so that I can find related questions if I have any.</li>
        <li id="fat">US5: As a crypto exchange user, I want to be able to access chat online so that I can address urgent questions if I have any.</li>
        <li>US6: As a new crypto enthusiast, I want the interface to be simple so that I can navigate around easily.</li>

    <h3>Sitemap</h3>
    <p>I started the responsive design by planning the information architecture of the website. Creating a sitemap ensured new screens were placed in a flow that was intuitive and accessible. The sitemap provided a visual understanding of the navigational structure and what content and actions are shown for each page.</p>
<img class="sixty" src="images/sitemap.png" alt="Finhub sitemap">
<h3>Responsive Design</h3>
<p>After building the informational architecture I crafted digital wireframes with responsive design to provide an optimal viewing experience on screens of different sizes. The aim was to create responsive pages that look great on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.</p>

  <h3>Mockups</h3>
  <h4>Sign-in screen</h4>
  <p>The login screen would require a user to fill out a simple form to access the account. For extra protection of sensitive information,  I added two-factor authentication.</p>

    <p>The app makes users feel comfortable entering the world of cryptocurrency. Security concerns are addressed, and users can get access to education depending on the level of their current crypto involvement.</p>

<div class="part">
    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
  <p>In comparison with investments in traditional assets, cryptocurrency is still relatively new and unfamiliar to large groups of investors, hence the hesitations from users' side whether to invest in it or not. I found out that security is at the top of the priority lists.</p>
