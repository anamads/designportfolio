        <h1>Nordhom.</h1>
        <p>
          Nordhom is a home decor brand and a lifestyle boutique where creativity and design are a top priority. They aim to provide
          customers with special products that enhance their living space. The website takes users on a journey that allows them to see the
          seasonal campaigns and collections from the main screen.

            <h3>The Problem Space</h3>
            <img src="images/idea1.png">
          </div>
            <p>
          Being a relatively new brand, one of the main challenges Nordhom faces is the lack of loyalty and creating trust with their
          customers. Product returns due to the lack of clear visual descriptions is one of the issues the company faces.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <div class="menugrid">
          <h3>The Goal</h3>
          <img src="images/goal1.png">
        </div>
          <p>
          Create responsive design and a seamless and elegant user experience for a home decor online store. Provide clear descriptions and
          close-up imagery showing products in the smallest details. Convert shoppers into paying customers by minimizing returns and
          maximizing customers' understanding of the product. Balance placement of elements within the page to introduce new products.
        </p>

        <hr class="line" />
        <h3>Main Screen</h3>
        <p>
          For the main screen, I prioritized a short clear description along with the scrollable section including customers' favorites
          according to the analytics.
        </p>
        <img src="images/screen1.png" />
        <p>
          I proceeded with the Lighting section, made sure there is a call-to-action button, and added a selection of products with the
          highest click-through rate. For the products that had style variations, I also introduced the "Choose options" button, so that customers could see that there are more versions of the same product to explore.
        </p>
        <img src="images/screen2.png" />
        <p>
          Further, I included one of the most popular white ceramics collections, the CTA button, and a short selection of products from the
          collection. The last section included the website collections to save customers scrolling time and introduce the rest of the
          products.
        </p>
        <img src="images/screen3.png" />
        <h3>Other Elements</h3>
        <p> I added some details to further refine the seamless user experience.
        </p>
        <div class="elements">
          <div class="smallel">
            <img src="images/screen4.png" />
            <p>Every collection page included the links to other collections to further explore the website.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="smallel1">
            <p>Next to the product descriptions, I also added a selection of products a customer might like.</p>
            <img src="images/screen5.png" />
          </div>
          <div class="smallel">
            <img src="images/screen6.png" />
            <p>Every collection page included the links to other collections to further explore the website.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
        <p>
          I created a responsive design to provide an optimal viewing experience on screens of different sizes. For mobile devices, I opted
          for a two-column layout.
        </p>
        <img id="dif" src="images/screen7.png" />
        <h3>Social Media</h3>
        <p>
          For the social media, I prioritized vibrant colors. Considering one of the main goals which is to create trustworthy relationships
          with the customers, I included the close-up shots of the products.
        </p>
