          How can I create a mobile-first responsive website design to help people make contributions to the marine environment online so

          <p>
            I put high emphasis on creating empathatic connections and conducting interviews. That included questions such as asking to
            describe the experience with donations to charity organizations, being a member of one, or having an interest in a specific
            social issue. The Interview goal was to understand what drives people to volunteer their time and money to environmental causes
            and identify concerns and frustrations people experience while wanting to help.

      <p>The goal of the competitive audit was to compare the donations experience of each of the competitors' websites on different devices. For the purpose of this research, I analyzed the activity and digital experience of 4 organizations. Our competitors are widely known non-profits with a mission to protect whales and their environment.
</p>
<p>OCEAN ALLIANCE positions itself as one of the oldest non-profits with a mission to protect whales and their ocean environment through research, scientific collaboration, public education, and the arts. They place a big emphasis on collaboration and research to maximize efforts.</p>
<p>SAVE THE WHALES is focused on educating the public, especially children, about ocean inhabitants and fragile marine environments.</p>
<p>SEA SHEPHERD SOCIETY positions itself as a defender of all marine wildlife, without exception.</p>
<p>PACIFIC WHALE FOUNDATION positions itself as the ocean guardian in the face of emerging threats. As leaders in the development of responsible whale watching, they have developed a broad, holistic approach to marine tourism.

  Through an audit, some strengths and weaknesses were detected which are listed further.</p>

  <h3>Style Guide</h3>
  <p>Below is my final iteration of the vision for Awale, which shows several different design elements outlined in more detail. I created the logo using the symbolism of a whale in its natural environment. I leaned into light blue as my main color to capture the color of the water as a natural marine environment and I set this against crisp and refreshing shades. I was looking to maintain fresh, calm, inspiring, and natural tones throughout the digital experience. I chose Poppins for its clear and bold forms.</p>

  <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
  <p>After building the informational architecture I crafted a responsive design to provide an optimal viewing experience on screens of different sizes. The aim was to create responsive pages that look great on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.

  <h3>What I Learned</h3>
<p>While designing the Awale App, I learned that user feedback and research guided every iteration of the process. Designing pages for mobile first was a great way to help find what was most important within the experience.
  I understood the needs of users through conversations and user tests and created an engaging app from both visual and user perspectives.</p>
