        <h3>The Goal</h3>
        <p>The goal was to create a visual reperesentation of the sanding wheel to ensure clear difference between AbrasiveNow and competitor's solutions.
          In collaboration with a leading sanding wheel manufacturer, I undertook a comprehensive project to visually articulate the unique features of their products in comparison to competitors. Leveraging CGI based on detailed engineering drawings, I meticulously crafted visual representations that highlighted the intricacies setting their sanding wheels apart. The use of CGI proved essential, especially in the context of heavy machinery, providing clarity and detail that traditional photography could not match. Additionally, I contributed to the brand's identity by designing striking stickers for the wheels, ensuring a standout visual presence. Furthermore, I created engaging brochures tailored for industry fairs, seamlessly integrating technical information with compelling visuals to showcase the brand's innovation and quality. This holistic approach aimed to not only explain but also visually reinforce the distinctiveness of their sanding wheel products in the market.
